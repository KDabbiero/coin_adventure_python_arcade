# coin_adventure_python_arcade
# Overview

I created this game to try and gain an indepth understanding of Python Arcade. I wanted to learn more about views and using a Tile Map Editor. 

The purpose of the game is to shoot all of the coins that appear on the screen. To navigate you use the arrow keys and you click to shoot the laser at the coins. When you hover the mouse near the coins it aims the laser at the coin.

Games have always been somewhat of a weak point for me so I wanted to try and develop something that would help me improve my skills. Prior to this project I didn't know anything about game views or how to use a Tiled Map Editor.

# Useful Websites

* [Arcade Docs](https://arcade.academy/)
* [Tiled Map Editor Download](https://www.mapeditor.org/)

# Future Work

* Add enemies that try to attack the main character to prevent them from getting all the coins
* Randomly generate more coins than just 5
* Create Levels
* Create a view that displays when the main character has shot all the coins that displays that they have won and then go on to another level
* Other bells and whistles such as background music, jumping sounds, laser sounds, moving platforms, etc.
